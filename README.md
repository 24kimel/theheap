# The Heap: Internals and Security Vulnerabilities
[Tomer](https://github.com/commandlineinterface) and [I](https://github.com/24kimel) are happy to have written this [research paper about the heap](https://github.com/24kimel/theheap/blob/main/The_Glibc_Heap__Internals_and_Security_Vulnerabilities.pdf).
All of the source files presented here are referred to in the paper itself.
We hope you'll learn something new from this paper.

There are some URLs in the paper. If you'd like to click them, you'd need to download the PDF.

EDIT: We have noticed that in pages 22, 23, 28, and 29, some lines of code/comments overflow the width of the page. Until we fix these errors, the reader must refer to the source code above.
